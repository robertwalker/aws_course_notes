AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate 2018
==================================================

These are my notes taken from the AWS training course.

The notes are availiable in both Markdown and HTML. If you find any mistakes or other issues or simply want to enhance these notes with your own please don't hesitate to send me a pull request so that we can all benefit from this.

**Note:** Please submit all pull requests to the Markdown files. The HTML files are generated using the Markdown source.

This is a work in progress. As I continue my journey through the course I wull post updates along the way.
